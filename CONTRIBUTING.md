# Contributing

We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community. By contributing to Selenium IDE, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

### Bugs and Improvements

We use the issue tracker to keep track of bugs and improvements to Selenium IDE itself, its examples, and the documentation. We encourage you to open issues to discuss improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation, etc. If a topic has been discussed before, we will ask you to join the previous discussion.

As Selenium IDE is in it's very early stages, response time to pull requests might be long - as many fundamental issues are being considered and discussed.

### Getting Help

**As this is an early stage, the selenium IRC channel will do**

### Patience is Appreciated

Please keep in mind that people spend their free time trying to provide a working alternative to the old IDE.
This is a complete rewrite and there are some technological challenges to overcome.

## Development

Visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide/issues) to find a list of open issues that need attention.

### Sending a Pull Request

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.

On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a conversation *is* to send a pull request. Use your best judgement!

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

* Open a new issue in the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide/issues).
* Fork the repo.
* Create a new feature branch based off the `master` branch.
* Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
* Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
